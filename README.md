# Telco-Data-Cleansing

<p>The URL below is the python code Iâ€™ve created to perform simple data cleansing project on a Telecommunication Company Data. The dataset is unstructured data, so I manipulate it using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, thus it provides insights.

<p>Libraries Used In this analysis, several packages will be used to help us perform data analysis.

1. Pandas

Pandas (Python for Data Analysis) is a Python library that focuses on data analysis processes such as data manipulation, data preparation, and data cleaning.
- read_csv() is used to read csv files
- str.match() is used to match certain characters
- drop() is used to remove
- count() is used to count each variable
- drop_duplicates() is used to delete duplicate rows . data
- fillna() is used to fill with a certain value
- quantile() is used to see quantile to a certain
- mask() replaces the specified value if the condition meets
- astype() changes the data type
- value_counts() is used to count unique from column
- sort_values() is used to sort values
- isnull() is used to detect missing values
- dropna() is used to remove missing values
- replace() is used to replace the value

2. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python library that focuses on data visualization such as plotting graphs. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, Python and IPython shells, web application servers, and several other graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits.

figure() is used to create a new figure

3. Seaborn
Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and introduces additional plot types. It also makes your traditional Matplotlib plots look a little prettier.

box_plot() is used to create a box plot</p>
